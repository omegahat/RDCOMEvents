<h2>Version 0.3-1</h2>
<dl>
 <dt>
 <li> Minor fix to findConnectionPoint() which used is.list()
  rather than is(x, "list") or inherits(x, "list") to determine
  if result was a list of connection points or a single one.
 <dd>
</dl>

<h2>Version 0.2-0</h2>

<dl>

  <dt>
  <li> Added connectEventHandlers() as a high-level function
       for registering a collection of R functions as event handlers
       for a connection point. This simplifies the creation
       of a COMEventServerInfo and a COMEventServer object before
       connecting.  That avenue is of course still available when more control is 
       needed.
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>  Added IExpandedConnectionPoint and made this the default so that
      we have additional information about the connection point,
      specifically the host/parent object and also the UUID of the
      interface that an event sink/handler is expected to implement for that
      connection point/event source.
  <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Added an accessor (RDCOM_ProcessEvents) to the R_ProcessEvents routine so that we can
      process the event queue inline and so block for procedural-style
      code. 
  
 <dd>
 <dt>
 <li> Added guids to a server so that it can respond to QueryInterfaces
     and admit to interfaces that it implements. 
 <dd> This will be integrated into the RDCOMServer package more generally.

 <dt>
 <li>  More updates for getConnectionPoints() and findConnectionPoint().
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Fix for getConnectionPoints() to avoid errors when can't get 
    next values. Return what we already have.
 <dd>

 <dt>
 <li> Example for Excel.
 <dd>

</dl>
